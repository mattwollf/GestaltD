##Tutorial: Understanding the D Environment.

This is a series of tutorials which demonstrates the D ecology.
What does this mean? A language's ecology is the summation of tools and 
resources a programmer might use to create a workflow for his project.
Some examples of this might be:

* Using a compiler to build his project,
* Using git to version his source code.
* Using DUB to manage his project dependencies.
* Using Linux Containers to create a isolated virtual environment for his project.
* Using Debugging tools.

You'll notice, this isn't specifically about the D language. 
It is about leveraging tools to create a sane and more productive workflow. 

##Structure of the tutorial
You'll also notice that these tutorials are not linear in nature. 
They are written with the expectation that a person might be interested in learning 
one specific tool. Some tutorials might have some dependencies which require knowledge of other tools. 
However, most are written to be mostly self-contained.

All tutorials are written as a **"tech-tree"** which represents the D ecology as a whole. 
This "tech-tree" is broken into **"tech-branches"** which represent the knowledge 
needed to master a tool or technology.
Each "tech-branch" can be further broken down into several **"tech-leaf"** tutorials which 
introduces one simple concept and steps to master that one concept in 10 minutes. 

As a result of this structure, a student following along can choose a 
curriculum based on mastering a specific technology he might want to learn, 
or choose a curriculum based on his current level of proficency. 

##Don't just blindly follow a recipie. UNDERSTAND IT
Too many tutorials are written in a way that someone can simply copy-and-paste 
and never actually understand the significance of what they did. 
The goal of these tutorials isn't just to show someone how to do something, but 
also to UNDERSTAND what and why they did it.
To this effect each "tech-leaf" tutorial has exersises which encourage a 
student following along to think about what he did. There are also "extra-credit" 
sections which provide further exploration of the lesson.
Finally, each "tech-leaf" tutorial has a section dedicated to reading the documentation, 
such that, a person can hopefully teach himself if he has a problem or question.

#Getting Started
As stated previously, there are two reccommended paths: 

A student who is new to the D ecosystem might want to start with the 
[skill](/curriculum/skill.md) curriculum. This curriculum focuses on starting 
with a minimum knowledge base and sequentially adding to it.
This curriculum jumps around different technologies based on skill level. 
Once all the "Begginner" skills in all **tech-branches** have been mastered, 
the curriculum will escalate to the "Intermediate" skills and once again 
iterate through the "Intemediate" tutorials in all the **tech-branches**.

A student who is familiar with some or a majority of tools in the D ecosystem 
might prefer to start with the [proficency](/curriculum/proficency.md) curriculum which 
focus on specific technologies.
So, for instance, a person who wants to learn more about **DUB** specifically 
and ignore everything else, might choose the 
[proficency](/curriculum/proficency.md) curriculum.
