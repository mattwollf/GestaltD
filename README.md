Tutorial: Understanding the D Environment.

This tutorial demonstrates the "best practices" for understanding and developing for the D environment as a whole. Included are a showcase of common and useful tools and techniques you can use to create a cohiesive project utilizing the best D has to offer.

Disclaimer: This isn't a tutorial for learning D as a lanugage. It is a tutorial to gain a better understanding about how all these tools and techniques can be used together to create a productive workflow. References will be provided to direct you to useful documentation for these tools, but it is expected that you have at least a passing understanding of what they are.

Instead, the goal of this tutorial is to demonstrate "best practices" in a rather opinionated way, such that by the end a person can create a workflow which is somewhat rational and can be understood and shared easily.

In the end, you should have enough knowledge to:
* [Install](./T001: InstallDMD.md) the D compiler.
* Start a project from scratch.
* Create a git repository for the project.
* Use DUB.
* Use advanced architectural patterns like MVC.
* Build a non-trivial application using multiple libraries and tools in conjunction with each other.
* Build unit tests.
* Write documentation.
* Build for Development, Testing, and Stable Release cycles.
* Share the project with the community.
